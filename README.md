# Torob and Snap SMS Bomber

This repository contains two Python scripts, `Torob.py` and `Snap.py`, that can be used to send multiple SMS messages to a target phone number.

## Installation

To use these scripts, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

```
git clone https://github.com/Javadkarami-com/sms-bomber.git
cd sms-bomber
```

## Usage

### Torob.py

To use the `Torob.py` script, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python Torob.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the target phone number and the number of SMS messages to send. Once you've entered this information, the script will start sending SMS messages to the target number.

### Snap.py

To use the `Snap.py` script, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python Snap.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the target phone number. Once you've entered the number, the script will start sending SMS messages to the target number in an infinite loop.

**Note:** These scripts are designed for educational and research purposes only. Using them to harass or spam others is unethical and may be illegal in some jurisdictions.

## API

The `Torob.py` script uses the Torob API to send SMS messages, while the `Snap.py` script uses the Snap API. Both scripts make HTTP requests to the respective API endpoints to send the SMS messages.
